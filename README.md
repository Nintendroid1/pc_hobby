## Getting Started
You will need Git and Node.js installed on your machine.  For Git, I recommended downloading the [GitHub Desktop tool](https://desktop.github.com/) which is OSX and Windows compatible.   

```Powershell
# Clone source code to local computer
git clone https://github.com/Nintendroid1/pc_hobby pc_hobby
cd pc_hobby

# Install project dev dependencies
npm install 

# Start server and view the webpage
gulp
```
